SpaceX API React Project

This React project utilizes the SpaceX API to display general information about SpaceX, about crew, dragons and capsules. It features a responsive design, sticky header, and a burger menu for smaller devices. 

Features

- Fetches data from the SpaceX API using 'fetch' queries.
- Utilizes React hooks like 'useEffect' and 'useState' for managing state.
- Uses 'Link' and 'useParams' from 'react-router-dom' for routing and parameter handling.
- Implements a sticky header for easy navigation.
- Includes a burger menu for smaller devices using CSS and JavaScript.
- Features responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Utilizes 'localStorage' to store and retrieve 'dragonItem' data for a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React Router (for routing)
- SpaceX API (for fetching data)
